In this lab you will work with a set of 160,000 tweets, which include sentiment labels. \n\nSocial media sentiment is an important indicator of public opinion.  Determining sentiment can be valuable in a number of applications including brand awareness, product launches, and detecting political trends. \n\nRaw text is inherently messy. Machine understanding and analysis is inhibited by the presence of extraneous symbols and words that clutter the text. The exact nature of the required text cleaning depends on the application.  In this case, you will focus on text cleaning to facilitate sentiment classification.The presence of certain words determines the sentiment of the tweet. Words and symbols which are extraneous to this purpose are distractions at best, and a likely source of noise in the analysis. You will follow these steps to prepare the tweet text for analysis: \n\n- Symbols and unnecessary white space which do not convey sentiment are removed, leaving only alphabetic characters.\n- There is no difference in the sentiment conveyed by a word in upper case or lower case, so all case is set to lower. \n- Stop words are words that occur with high frequency in text, but do not have any particular meaning. Examples include word like \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098the\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098and\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 and \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098this\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099. Since these words are relatively common, yet communicate no particular sentiment, they can bias analytics.  Therefore, stopwords which do not convey sentiment are therefore removed from the tweet text.\n- stem is a root word. For example, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098go\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 is the root word of conjugated verbs, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098going\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098goes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098gone\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099. The meaning of these words is the same in terms of analysis. A process known as stemming is applied to transform words to their roots, before analysis. \n\n\n## What you will need\nTo complete this lab, you will need the following:\n- A web browser and Internet connection\n- An Azure ML workspace\n- The lab files for this lab\n\n\n## Load and transform the tweet data\n\nAs a first step, ensure that you have uploaded the **tweets.csv** and **stopwords.csv ** files as new datasets in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
