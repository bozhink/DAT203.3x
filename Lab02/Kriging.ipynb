The values of metal concentrations are sampled at certain spatial points. The spatial sampling is not performed on a close-spaced regular grid. Therefore, spatial interpolation or kriging is used to create a map of the expected concentration of metal polution. Specifically, you will: \n\n- Load and examine the properties of these data.\n- Explore the spatial dependency using the variogram of the metal polution data.\n- Use kriging to interpolate and create a map of metal polution.\n\n## What you will need\nTo complete this lab, you will need the following:\n- A web browser and Internet connection\n- The lab files for this lab\n\n****\n**Note** To set up the required environment for the lab, follow the instructions in the Setup document from the Setup folder.\n****\n\n## Load and Examine the Data\nAs a first step, execute the code below to load the metal polution data set, and examine its contents.
